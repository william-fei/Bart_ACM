# Direcotry Structure

Here is the directory structure (copied from the output of tree command.)
suitable for development with Jupyter Lab/Notebook, Python, and Jupytex

#+begin_example
|____config
|____data
|____doc
|____README.md
|____src
| |____notebooks
| |____scripts
| | |____libs
|____test
#+end_example

- config :: configurations required for the project
- data   :: storage of data for the project
- doc    :: put documents helpful for the project here
- README.md :: Read it first to understand the project
- test   :: Having test cases here is "kosher"!
- src    :: the folder for the source code
- notebooks :: in src, the notebooks developed with Jupyter Lab and Jupytext,
  they are the dua-images of the python files in scripts folder
- scripts :: the python files for the notebooks and libraries
- libs    :: the folder for the python libraries

Note, with [[https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext][Jupytext]], one can use python file to create and modify notebooks with
Markdown syntax. It makes developing notebooks much effective and also more
conducive for git version control.

With Jupytex, the typical workflow is as follows
1. Edit on the python file
2. Reload the python file (Opened with notebook)
3. Perform data exploration more convenient in notebook, save any edits
4. Repeat
